# Theme book

The book is built using bootstrap rendering.
Built-in bootstrap themes can be applied or we can apply css code to personalize 
the appearance of the book.

Themes can be previewed  at [**Bootswatch**](https://bootswatch.com/), for instance the
[_*Morph*_](https://bootswatch.com/morph/) theme.

The color theme "#0403b2" was provided in Hex format, and selected using [**color-hex**](https://www.color-hex.com/color/0403b2).
