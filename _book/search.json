I will extract stock prices for the major computer manufacturing companies, build a fictional stock index, and analyze the fluctuations of prices over time.\nThe project relies on R libraries to extract stock data from databases. I then, either use functions from existing packages, or build my own package, to analyze stock data and build a custom stock index.",

    "text": "Introduction to networks and food webs\nYou might remember from high school hearing about the food chain: that herbivores eat plants, carnivores eat those herbivores, and so on in a successive chain of food relationships. Relationships can be represented as data and analysed using algorithms.\nThe food web is an extension of this concept. Because there exists many species of plants, herbivores, and carnivores in an ecosystem, there exists many interconnected food chains. The food web represents those interconnected food chains at the scale of an ecosystem and it can be mapped as a network of interactions between species.\nEcological networks, such as food webs, can be represented in mathematics as a matrix, converted to a graph, and analysed using algorithms developed for network and graph theories.\nWe can imagine food webs as social media networks, but instead of representing relationships between friends, we have relationships between enemies.",

In the illustration below, each node (or species) is represented by a circle at the exception of the top predator—the Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua; each link is represented by an arrow pointing from the prey to the predator.\n\n\n\nGraphical representation of a food web",
